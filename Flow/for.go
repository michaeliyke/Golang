/*
Go for loop has three components separated by semicolons:

the init statement: executed before the first iteration
the condition expression: evaluated before every iteration
the post statement: executed at the end of every iteration
The init statement will often be a short variable declaration, and
 the variables declared there are visible only in the scope of
  the for statement.

The loop will stop iterating once the boolean condition evaluates
 to false.
